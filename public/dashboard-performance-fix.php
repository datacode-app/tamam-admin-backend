echo "✅ Database connection: WORKING\n";
echo "❌ DashboardController: 50+ complex queries\n";
echo "❌ Remote database latency: High\n";
echo "❌ No caching: Every page load re-queries\n";
echo "❌ Complex joins: Wishlist, Orders, Reviews, etc.\n\n";

echo "📊 QUERY ANALYSIS (lines in DashboardController.php):\n";
echo "• Lines 711-726: Wishlist popular stores (complex joins)\n";
echo "• Lines 727-741: Top selling items (heavy aggregation)\n";
echo "• Lines 742-756: Top rated foods (rating calculations)\n";
echo "• Lines 758-765: Top delivery men (order counts)\n";
echo "• Lines 767-773: Top customers (order counts)\n";
echo "• Lines 775-784: Top restaurants (order counts)\n";

echo "1. Enable query caching (5-minute cache)\n";

echo "🎯 RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:\n";
echo "1. Add caching to DashboardController::dashboard_data()\n";
echo "2. Use simpler queries for initial load\n";
echo "3. Load heavy data via AJAX after page load\n";
echo "4. Consider using database views for complex queries\n";
echo "5. Add indexes on frequently queried columns\n\n";

echo "📝 IMMEDIATE ACTION:\n";
echo "The dashboard works but loads slowly due to query complexity.\n";
echo "For production use, implement caching on the dashboard_data() method.\n";
echo "Current system is functional - optimization is a performance enhancement.\n";
