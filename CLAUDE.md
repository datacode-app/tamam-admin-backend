- remember to deploy to staging server we use deploy-to-staging.sh
- remember to always clean the test and verification files or notes you took while working on the project so we have a clean root directory for all projects
- we should always use the remote data cluster and o3 storage from digital ocean
- always clean up after your self, if you create files for verifications tesign which are not crucial and useful for later,just delete them when you've done
